# Balanced Binary Search Tree in Java

This is a simple Java program that creates a balanced binary search tree (BST) from an array. The program provides the following functionalities:

1. **Add a new node** to the BST
2. **Delete a node** from the BST
3. **Search** for a node in the BST
4. **Output the BST in order**
5. **Output the BST in pre-order**
6. **Output the BST in post-order**
7. **Output the root node**
8. **Exit the program**
